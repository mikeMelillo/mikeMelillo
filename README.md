      Semantic Modelling for the Built Space (https://project-haystack.org/, https://brickschema.org/)
      Python for Data Analysis      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, trying to get my feet wet with some of the regular toolkits (numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc.), and then apply them to some business use cases.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on using simple statistical models to analyze (and visualize) building systems.
